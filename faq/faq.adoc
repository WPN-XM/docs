This page exists to answer common questions about the WPN-XM server stack.  It
is a reference to answer oft-repeated questions people in the WPN-XM community
encounter. It is not a complete guide to the server stack, nor a tool for
teaching how to use it.

If there is some common or important question you feel is wrongly left
unanswered here, feel free to help us fix it.

== How do I install WPN-XM?

You find the http://wpn-xm.github.io/docs/user-manual/en/#_installation[installation guide] in the user-manual.

== Does WPN-XM include MySQL or MariaDB?

WPN-XM ships MariaDB since the beginning of the project.

MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL. The commands and tools are the same for both.
Although there are subtle differences regarding https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-vs-mysql-features/[features]
and https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-vs-mysql-compatibility/[compatibility].

== How do I start and stop WPN-XM?

* You can use the "Server Control Panel". It is started with:

 wpn-xm.exe

You find more information about using the SCP in the http://wpn-xm.github.io/docs/user-manual/en/#_using_the_server_control_panel[user-manual].

* You can also use http://wpn-xm.github.io/docs/user-manual/en/#_files[batchfiles] to start or stop servers. 

== How can I install a server as a service?

Services are not supported, yet. See https://github.com/WPN-XM/WPN-XM/issues/165[Issue #165].

== Is WPN-XM production ready?

[WARNING]
====
WPN-XM is a development environment, which is not meant for production use.

It is not configured in a secure way. This allows developers to start new projects fastly.

Please secure WPN-XM, if you want to make it accessible via the network to people outside your LAN.
This is a huge security risk! A firewall or an external router will only provide a low level of security.
====

[NOTE]
====
We are looking for contributions to our security checklist.
This list should act as a starting point, for a developer trying to secure the server environment.
It's by no means complete. You have to fix all security issues manually.

**Security Checklist**

- delete the webinterface (`www\tools\webinterface`)
- remove or access protect all other tools, e.g. `www\tools\adminer`, `www\tools\phpmyadmin`
- add password protections to the servers
- configure your firewall to open only for protocols and ports of servers you really need
- move the public folder to a new and empty partition, adjust paths in nginx.conf
- use a dedicated user with restricted permissions to run the server environment
====

== How do I uninstall WPN-XM?

Please use the Uninstaller in the root folder.

== What are the "Lite" and "LiteRC" versions of WPN-XM?

WPN-XM Lite and LiteRC are our smallest packaged installers. Lite means "light-weight".

The Lite installers provide only a few essential software components to get quickly started, 
including Nginx, PHP, MariaDB, Xdebug, Composer. 

Of course, some servers and tools provided in the Standard or Full packages will be missing.

== I have trouble starting and stopping daemons using the Server-Control-Panel. What can i do?

If the SCP doesn't work, then please try to use the batch files `start-wpnxm.bat` and `stop-wpnxm.bat` instead.
You might check, whether daemons are running with `status-wpnxm.bat`.

== Where should I place my web content?

The main folder for your projects is `\www`.

Please create a new folder for your project. For example:

- let's create a folder "myproject", so you get `\www\myproject`
- and put a simple HTML file `test.html` with the following content in this directory: 

```
<?php
   echo 'Hello World! This is my project.'; 
?>
```

You can access it by using the URI `http://localhost/myproject/test.html`.

== Can I move the WPN-XM installation?

No, that's not supported, yet. 

== What are "automatic start pages" for the "\www" directory and it's subfolders?

Nginx is configured to serve the following files as index pages: `index.php`, `index.html`, `index.htm`.

This is done by using Nginx's 
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_index_module.html[index directive] inside a location block:

  location / {
      index  index.php index.html index.htm;
  }

The server will automatically try to serve one of these files,
when you access a folder without specifying a file in the URI.
Files are checked in the specified order. 

When those files are not found, the server will display the 
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_autoindex_module.html[directory listing] (autoindex).

== Where can I change the configuration?

== My anti-virus software reports that WPN-XM contains a virus!?

It's possible that an antivirus software erroneously  identifies a file as
containing a virus or being malware, when the file is clean. That happens,
because Antivirus programs often use heuristics to identify malware and viruses.
Sometimes these heuristics fail and the program reports a `false positive`.

We transmit `false positives` as samples to several online anti-virus labs for
further analysis. You can also use the online tool Virus Total for  scanning
files of WPN-XM.

== What can i do, when the MySQL/MariaDB daemon won't start?

Please start mysqld manually by running `mysqld --console` on the CLI in the folder `\server\mariadb\bin`.
You will get a startup log with more pieces of information about the reason.
Often the cause is a misconfiguration in `my.ini` or accidentally modified or deleted files in the data folder.

== What can i do, when Innosetup Script does not compile because of unknown tokens, like `@STACK_VERSION@`?

You can uncomment the line below to be able to compile the script locally from the IDE.
 
 ;#define COMPILE_FROM_IDE

The constant `COMPILE_FROM_IDE` will use a fixed string `LocalSnapshot` instead of the dynamic token "@STACK_VERSION@".

== What can i do, if the MySQL daemon isn't starting up?

Check the console output when trying to start the daemon manually.

 cd server\bin\mariadb\bin
 mysqld --console

== Why do i get socket errors, while step debugging with XDebug?

Check the Nginx `error.log`. If you see errormessages like `upstream timed out`,
then try to increase the `fastcgi_read_timeout` in your `nginx.conf`. Do not forget to restart the daemon.
The value defaults to 60s. Which might be enough for production, but clearly not for development/debugging,
because of the long running fastcgi process that does not produce any output until it is finished.
See the related Nginx Wiki page: http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpFastcgiModule[Nginx - Module - HttpFastcgi].

== What can i do, when Nginx wont' start or shuts down immediately and Port 80 is used.

Immediate shutdowns are an indicator that the port 80, which Nginx uses by default is already taken.
You will also find the following message in the Nginx `error.log`: `bind() to 127.0.0.1:80 failed`.
Please check, if the port is in use with `netstat -ab` or by using a helper tool, like http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/cports.html[CurrPorts].

If the port is used by "System PID 4", then the service "WWW-Publishingservice" (w3svc) is using the port and you might disable it by using the `services.msc` control panel.

== How to start the installation wizard in the shared folder of a VM?

 ShellExecuteEx Error - System cannot find the path specified.

The installer can not be executed in the shared folder of a virtual machine.
It needs to be copied into a non-shared folder and started there.

== How to test, if mails are send on Windows?

You would install a fake sendmail server, which listens at a specific port (usally 25) for new mail and saves it to a specific folder. You can then read the file and test it for correct mail rendering.

The are several fake sendmail tools (1-5) and servers (5-6) around :

1. Test Mail Server Tool - http://www.toolheap.com/test-mail-server-tool/
2. Fake Sendmail - http://glob.com.au/sendmail/
3. smtp4dev - http://smtp4dev.codeplex.com/
4. Papercut - http://papercut.codeplex.com/
5. xmailserver - 1,4MB - http://www.xmailserver.org/
6. hmailserver - 3,4MB - http://www.hmailserver.com/

WPN-XM ships "Fake Sendmail".

If you need a real SMTP tool, try http://www.blat.net/ or http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/.

== Why is there a "reversed" N in WPÐ˜-XM?

The "reversed" N is cyrillic and used intentionally to indicate that the stack includes Nginx ("engine x").
We use the "reversed" N as the initial letter for Nginx in our project name and logo.

Other logos apply the same "graphical hint" and reverse the second N:
