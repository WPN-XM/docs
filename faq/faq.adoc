I have trouble starting and stopping daemons using the Server-Control-Panel. What can i do?::

If the SCP doesn't work, then please try to use the batch files "start-wpnxm.bat" and "stop-wpnxm.bat" instead. You might check, whether daemons are running with "status-wpnxm.bat".

The MySQL/MariaDB daemon won't start. What can i do?::

Please start mysqld manually by running `mysqld --console` on the CLI in the folder `\server\mariadb\bin`.
You will get a startup log with more pieces of information about the reason.
Often the cause is a misconfiguration in `my.ini` or accidentally modified or deleted files in the data folder.

Innosetup Script does not compile because of unknown tokens, like @APPVERSION@::

If you want to build the installation wizard manually, then you need to replace the token with something appropriate, like replacing @APPVERSION@ with a version number, e.g. 1.2.3 (major.minor.build).

The MySQL daemon isn't starting up.::

Check the console output when trying to start the daemon manually.

`cd server\bin\mariadb\bin`

`mysqld --console`

While step debugging with XDebug i get Socket errors::

Check the Nginx "error.log". If you see errormessages like "upstream timed out",
then try to increase the "fastcgi_read_timeout" in your "nginx.conf". Do not forget to restart the daemon.
The value defaults to 60s. Which might be enough for production, but clearly not for development/debugging,
because of the long running fastcgi process that does not produce any output until it is finished.
See the related Nginx Wiki page: [Nginx - Module - HttpFastcgi](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpFastcgiModule)

Nginx wont' start or shuts down immediately. Port 80 used.::

Immediate shutdowns are an indicator that the port 80, which Nginx uses by default is already taken.
You will also find the following message in the Nginx `error.log`: `bind() to 127.0.0.1:80 failed`.
Please check, if the port is in use with `netstat -ab` or by using a helper tool, like [CurrPorts](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/cports.html).

If the port is used by "System PID 4", then the service "WWW-Publishingservice" (w3svc) is using the port and you might disable it by using the `services.msc` control panel.

Starting the installation wizard in the shared folder of a VM::

`ShellExecuteEx Error - System cannot find the path specified.`

The installer can not be executed in the shared folder of a virtual machine.
It needs to be copied into a non-shared folder and started there.

How to test, if mails are send on Windows?::

You would install a fake sendmail server, which listens at a specific port (usally 25) for new mail and saves it to a specific folder. You can then read the file and test it for correct mail rendering.

The are several fake sendmail tools (1-5) and servers (5-6) around :

1. Test Mail Server Tool - http://www.toolheap.com/test-mail-server-tool/
2. Fake Sendmail - http://glob.com.au/sendmail/
3. smtp4dev - http://smtp4dev.codeplex.com/
4. Papercut - http://papercut.codeplex.com/
5. xmailserver - 1,4MB - http://www.xmailserver.org/
6. hmailserver - 3,4MB - http://www.hmailserver.com/

WPN-XM ships "Fake Sendmail".

If you need a real SMTP tool, try http://www.blat.net/ or http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/.

Why is there a "reversed" N in WPÐ˜-XM?::

The "reversed" N is cyrillic and used intentionally to indicate that the stack includes Nginx ("engine x").
We use the "reversed" N as the initial letter for Nginx in our project name and logo.

Other logos apply the same "graphical hint" and reverse the second N:
