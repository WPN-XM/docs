=== Composer

Composer is a CLI tool for dependency management in PHP. 
It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

All our installers ship Composer out-of-the-box. 

==== Installation Location

The default installaton folder is `server\bin\composer`.

The folder contains two files: `composer.phar` and `composer.bat`.

==== Configuration

The installer will set `server\bin\composer` to the ENV PATH.

This makes `composer.bat` available system-wide.

==== Usage

To run Composer on the CLI type:

`composer`

==== PHP Configuration for Composer

Users often ask "How to disable Xdebug for Composer runs on the CLI?".

We provide a separate PHP configuration file (https://github.com/WPN-XM/software/blob/master/php/config/composer/php.ini[`php.ini`]) for `Composer` runs. 

Whenever you invoke `composer.bat` or run `composer` on the CLI, 
then this minimal config will be used to start PHP and run Composer.

The purpose of this config is to speed Composer runs up by removing unneeded extensions, like xDebug, from the interpreter.

**Why?**

There is a huge impact of just loading Xdebug. 
It slows the Composer run down by 3x or 4x, even when the profiling feature is not enabled.
In other words: xdebug is invaluable for debugging, but increases the memory used and processing time of Composer.
