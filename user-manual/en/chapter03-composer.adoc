=== Composer

Composer is a CLI tool for dependency management in PHP. 
It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

==== Installation Location

The default installaton folder is `server\bin\composer`.

The folder contains two files: `composer.phar` and `composer.bat`.

==== Configuration

The installer will set `server\bin\composer` to the ENV PATH.

This makes `composer.bat` available system-wide.

==== Usage

To run Composer on the CLI type:

`composer`
