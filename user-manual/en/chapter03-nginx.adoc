=== Nginx

Nginx ("engine x") is a web server written by Igor Sysoev in 2002. It can act as a reverse proxy
server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer and an HTTP
cache. Nginx runs on Unix, Linux, BSD variants, OS X, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and Windows. Nginx is
free and open source software and released under the terms of a BSD-like license.

==== Installation Location

The default installaton folder is `server\bin\nginx`.

==== Configuration

The main configuration file is `nginx.conf` in the folder `server\bin\nginx\conf\`.

The stack ships also a very minimal configuration for debugging purposes: 
https://github.com/WPN-XM/software/blob/master/nginx/config/nginx.conf.debug[`nginx.conf.debug`].

[NOTE]
====
If you want to pass environment variables to PHP, 
you might set them as FGCI parameters (`fastcgi_param`) in the config.
====

For more advanced configuration examples take a look at the https://github.com/lebinh/nginx-conf repository. 

==== SSL Configuration

You might use https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/[Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator]
to create a decent SSL configuration for Nginx. 
There are also https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS[Mozilla's Server Side TLS Guidelines] 
with more details on these configurations. 
If you need to test the configuration of a live servers you could use https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/[SSLLabs].

==== Server Blocks (sites-enabled and sites-disabled)

This main configuration file `nginx.conf` includes other configuration files from the folder
`server\bin\nginx\conf\sites-enabled`.  These configuration files are mostly server blocks. They
contain directives to serve specific PHP applications,   configure proxy forwarding or define
application specific URL rewrite rules, which are needed to enable nice looking URLs without
parameters.

The server stack ships several server blocks by default in the folder `server\bin\nginx\conf\sites-
disabled`.  To use one of these files, simply move or copy them to the `server\bin\nginx\conf\sites-
enabled` folder and restart Nginx.  The new server block configuration is then automatically
included.

You find configuration files for various applications also on Github: https://github.com/WPN-
XM/software/tree/master/nginx/config/conf/sites-disabled

==== root and server_name

The most important directives in a server block are `root` and `server_name`, next to the
configuration of the rewrite rules for the specific application.

The `root` directive defines a relative path to the project, e.g. `www/<my_project_folder>`. But a
hardcoded path will work too, e.g. `c:\server\www\my_project_folder`. The `server_name` directive
defines which server block is used for a given request.

A very basic example for Wordpress: `root www/wordpress` and `server_name wordpress.dev`. This makes
Wordpress available at the URLs http://localhost/wordpress and http://wordpress.dev. The URL
http://wordpress.dev needs an additional entry in your `hosts` file.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to adjust your `hosts` file accordingly!

==== Defining an upstream pool and using "load balancing"

This section explains what an upstream pool is and how to configure it.

We start with a brief explanation on how web servers interface with servers that generate web pages
dynamically. The web server itself doesn't know about the language your are programming in. But how
can the web server process and respond to requests for dynamically generated pages?

The web server communicates with a third-party server in a standardized way, 
which is either a gateway protocol or an embeded handler.

The Common Gateway Interface (CGI), a standard way for web servers to interface with executable
programs installed on a server that generate web pages dynamically. CGI Version 1.1 is 
specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875[RFC 3875] (actually it's just a memo).

For processing PHP requests this CGI server is `php-cgi`.

For request processing Apache supports either `CGI` or `mod_php` or `mod_fcgi`, 
while Nginx supports `fcgi`. 

**Whats the difference?**

===== CGI

The CGI approach means, that for every incoming request a new CGI process is spawned in the
background to process the request, just to shut down at the end of processing. Process spawning
consumes time and memory, while at the same time the PHP interpreter consumes time and memory for
generating the output. This causes high workloads for servers, when multiple requests hit a website.

The overhead of process creation can be reduced by either using FastCGI or by running webserver
extension modules, such as mod_php.  With FastCGI interpreter processes are "preforked" and already
exist for processing.  With mod_php the interpreter is part of the web server and running as a
webserver extension module.

===== MOD_PHP

The `mod_php` approach is probably the default way to combine PHP and Apache. 
Here the PHP interpreter is "embedded" inside the Apache process as "Module PHP". 
Based on the Apache config and especially your worker configuration, 
it will automatically spawn new workers (childs) to process the incoming requests. 
Apache handles worker respawns and multiple requests.

===== MOD_FCGI and FCGI ("prefork")

The `mod_fcgi` approach is also an Apache Module living inside the Apache process.
It starts (preforks) a sufficient number instances of the CGI program to handle concurrent requests, 
and these programs remain running to handle further incoming requests.

The difference between Apache and Nginx in regard to FCGI handling is, 
that Apache manages the number of instances, while Nginx doesn't.
When using Nginx you have to make sure that the third-party FCGI servers are started and listening,
that the number is sufficient to process your requests and 
that the servers are properly defined in Nginx's upstream configuration.

Then requests are accepted by Nginx and forwarded to the external FCGI server for processing.

`Requests -> Nginx -> Rule for ".php" files -> fastcgi_pass -> external FCGI (php-cgi) -> Response (dynamically generated) -> Nginx -> Response`

===== Whats the difference between FCGI and CGI?

FCGI is basically CGI, but without the shutdown. The FCGI process is spawned once and stays in
listening mode. The upside is that the response/request latency is lower than with CGI, leading to
faster response times, because the "boot time" of CGI is gone and consuming less resources.

But, the downside is, that it is only one process. When multiple requests need to be processed, but
the FCGI server is already processing a long running request, then the stack will "block".

Now, in order to handle even more requests: you could setup one or more Nginx processes accepting
requests, which pass requests forward to one or more external FCGI servers, and these can also have
childs.  Example: 8 Nginx processes passing requests to a pool of 8 FCGI servers with 10 childs each.

==== Nginx "Load Balancing" algorithms

**What's the best "load balancing" configuration?**

It's hard to answer this question in general. 
There is no single best "load balancing" configuration, because it depends on your use-case.
In order to compare configurations, you would need to come up with some alternative configurations,
measure them under a high request load and finally compare the results to draw a conclusion.

Nginx provides numerous ways to configure the balancing:

. `round-robin` - default
. `least_conn` - http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#least_conn
. `ip_hash` - http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#ip_hash
. `hash key [consistent]` - http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#hash (ketama)
. `least_time` (only Nginx+) - http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#least_time

For instance, you could use `ip_hash` to allow session persistence (for login/re-login), but `hash key [consistent]` 
has probably the same effect, but uses a different algorithm in the background (libketama). 

When you just want to spread load across servers and the application has no demand for session consistency, 
then the default "round robin" balancing is better and faster, because it doesn't spend time and resources 
on hashing a given key or client IP address.

==== Alternative Nginx Builds for Windows

The WPN-XM Server Stack uses Nginx builds from the offical website. But there
are also some interesting private builds around. Sadly, their builds and build
toolchains are not open-source, so the builds are completely private and re-
building is not possible. Due to this fact, i can not include these builds into
WPN-XM.

You have the choice to download them on your own risk and simply replace WPN-XM's Nginx folder.

1. Official Nginx - http://nginx.org/

This is the offical Nginx Windows build from the main nginx website.
We ship this one by default.

Download: http://nginx.org/en/download.html

2. Nginx-Win - http://nginx-win.ecsds.eu/

This is an unofficial private build.
The source for the build, patches and adjusted modules and toolchain are not open-source.
The build includes lots of performance tweaks, additional modules compiled in and multi-worker support.
For instance, support for SPDY, rtmp, LUA, Naxsi WAF was added.

My request to open-source the toolchain for builds on Travis-Ci and for cooperation was denied.

The real name of the author is unknown.

5. https://github.com/Qihoo360/nginx-openresty-windows

This is an unoffical private build.
It's a combination of OpenResty and Nginx.
Lots of additional modules

==== Nginx Catch-All *.dev domains

This is a catch all configuration, which maps all project folder names to `.dev` domains.

```
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name ~^(.*)\.dev$;
    set $file_path $1;

    root /www/$file_path/public

    index index.php index.html

    # etc.
}
```

Then create a `index.php` file in a new project folder `www\myproject` with the content
`<?php echo 'Hello from folder: ' . __DIR__;`.

Now, update your `hosts` file accordingly and include `myproject.dev`.

Done. You can now access `myproject.dev` in your browser.
