=== Enabling High-DPI Support

When you are using a high dpi display, the icons, buttons and text of the SCP might be tiny.
While we are still trying to solve this issue, here is a workaround.

Steps:

. Right-click `wpn-xm.exe`
. Click on `Properties`
. Go to tab `Compatibility`
. Enable the checkbox for "Override High-DPI Scaling behaviour.", so that scaling is performed by the system
