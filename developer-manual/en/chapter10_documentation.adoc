=== AsciiDoc

We are using Asciidoc for documentation writing. AsciiDoc is a human-readable document format, 
semantically equivalent to DocBook XML, but using plain-text mark-up conventions.

We create the User-Manual and this Developer-Manual in HTML and PDF format.

The HTML output is generated by by `AsciiDoctor`.
The PDF output is generated by `AsciiDoctor-pdf`.
