With the icon (using the right mouse button), you can also start and stop the
servers.

You need at least to start the Nginx and PHP daemon to get started. If you want
to use a database connection you will also need to start the MariaDB daemon.
Depending on your needs you can start, stop and restart other servers like
MongoDB or Memcached. Or you can access the configuration, logs and error log
files. When a daemon has been started, the status becomes green. If the status
stays gray there is something wrong with the configuration of that daemon of the
operating systems prevents that the IP ports gets opened or is already opened by
another service (IIS for example) or daemon. See https://github.com/WPN-XM/WPN-
XM/wiki/FAQ[FAQ page] for some details about troubleshooting and how to solve
problems.
